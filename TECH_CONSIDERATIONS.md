- HOW MANY HOURS THE CHALLENGE TOOK YOU TO COMPLETE: 8.5 hours part 1, 1 hour part 2

- THE TECH STACK YOU CHOSE AND WHY

  React - components and native state management are straightforward and suited for this simple of an app/
  Typescript - to ensure data types are correct and avoid unnecessary errors down the line.

- ANY ADDITIONAL TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS YOU MADE

  I used sass to make more sense of the css when reading it. I also utilized variables for the colors to make them easier to change later. I also used semantic due to the slick designs/

- WHAT YOU WOULD DO IF YOU HAD MORE TIME

  If I had more time I would implement more animations for the paragraph section of the page explaining why its worth working for airtable. There is opportunity to create more movement with that section. I would also include unit tests for each component.

- HOW YOU WOULD MAKE THE EXPERIENCE BETTER

  I would add a section for potential candidates to enter an email address and their skills/ strenghts so we can contact them for roles in the future. We could ensure the candidate that by doing this they would be the first to know about a new role.

Consideration:

- When the screen width gets down to 600px I styled the page for an iPhone. It stays styled
  this way all the way down to 375px for an iPhone and below. For this part of the challenge there was no indication on what that should look like. The specs that were indicated did not look acceptable without this modification so I adapted.

- There was no asset for the colored arrow under every department name. So I just used a
  regular line. I would be happy to implement it with that asset once I get a hold of it.

- There is an error in the console: Warning: findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode.
  I can definitely figure out how to get rid of it but I'm submitting now for the sake of time
